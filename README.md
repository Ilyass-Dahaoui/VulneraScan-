# VulneraScan - Advanced Detection of Open-Source Code Vulnerabilities

## Description
**VulneraScan**  is an advanced tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in open-source code repositories. By leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Reinforcement Learning through Generative Robust Policy Optimization (GRPO), VulneraScan offers an efficient and automated solution for identifying security risks within open-source software. This system combines dynamic code analysis with reinforcement learning-based vulnerability detection, ensuring that potential threats are identified and mitigated early in the software development lifecycle.

This project aims to enhance the security of open-source codebases by pinpointing vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cyberattacks. Whether you're a developer, security researcher, or an organization utilizing open-source software, VulneraScan empowers you to safeguard your code and proactively avoid potential security breaches.
