# VulneraScan - Advanced Detection of Open-Source Code Vulnerabilities

## Description
**VulneraScan** is an advanced tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in open-source code repositories. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI techniques and deep learning models, VulneraScan provides an efficient and automated solution for identifying security risks within open-source software. The system uses a combination of static code analysis and deep learning-based vulnerability detection to ensure that potential threats are recognized early in the software development process.

This project focuses on improving the security of open-source codebases by identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cyberattacks. Whether you're a developer, a security researcher, or an organization relying on open-source software, VulneraScan helps you protect your code and avoid potential security breaches.
